Human interaction depends on communication, which many people take for granted. But, communication can be extremely difficult for persons 
who are deaf or have speech impairments. One means of communication for these people is sign language, but it can be challenging for those who do not know the language.
Machine learning models can be useful in this situation. In this project, i want to develop a machine learning model for sign language that will help deaf 
and speech-impaired people communicate.

# What it does  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/219947609-79458425-e1cc-40e5-b9e2-d1da95063c83.png" width="60" height="60"> 

The deaf and speech-impaired communities frequently face significant communication challenges. When speaking with someone who does not understand sign language 
for the speech-impaired, communication issues and misunderstandings may occur. Similar difficulties can arise when deaf persons try to communicate with those who 
do not understand sign language, which can lead to social exclusion.

Despite their potential value, conventional assistive solutions like text-to-speech software may not always be the best option. 
The development of a machine learning model that can accurately recognise and decipher sign language motions may help close the communication gap between the 
deaf community and non-deaf people. Sign language is a vital means of communication for the deaf community.
The sign language machine learning model translates sign language into English phrases by detecting the motions produced by the signer using a deep learning architecture. 
The programme predicts the appropriate English words and  organise the words into grammatically correct sentences. The resulting sentence can be displayed on a screen.
